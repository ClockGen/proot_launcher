Overview:

This script will launch an existing
armhf/arm64 distro installation in
a proot container.

When launched with no arguments, script
will launch a proot container,
specified in either user configuration
or default variables.

Typically, you just need to launch it
and script will do the rest
(installation of missing dependencies
and packages, configuration of the script,
installation and configuration of an
archlinux distro, installation and setup
of vnc and other system parts. You will be
asked for every action that needs your
approval).

Supported arguments:

--help, -h - prints out this text.

--install, -i - installation of an ArchLinuxARM
distributive (see installation section)

--setup, -s - run configuration wizard
(see configuration section)

/path/to/any/file - prompts a dialog with
program to open the file inside the
container (see termux integration
section).

Configuration:

At the first start, an installation
wizard will start. You'll be asked
to enter values as you like. Default
values should be fine and it is
only advisable to change these if you
know what you are doing.

To use the default value, simply press
enter (leave the field blank) when
asked for input.

When configuration is done, wizard
will write a configuration file at
~/.prootrc. You can edit it manually
too.

You can re-run setup wizard using a
corresponding argument.

Installation:

If no distributive is present at
configured installation path,
you will be asked to begin
installation.

The script will download archlinuxarm
archive for your architecture and md5
checksum file to installation path parent
directory. It will compare md5 sum and
extract the archive to installation path.
If target path is not empty, the script
will allow to purge it.

If the archive is recent (matches with
downloaded md5 sum), the script will
not redownload it, so you can manually
put the archive to installation path
parent directory.

After extracting, the script will remove
unnecessary folders from rootfs to free
some space.

Termux integration:

If you created symlink to
termux-file-editor during configuration,
you can quickly open files by sharing them
to termux with your android file manager
or any other app that supports share option.

After sharing the file, you will be asked
to select which program to use. You have
defined these programs during configuration.

After that, if there is no graphical
sessions running, a new one will be started
with program, selected earlier. Closing
the program will also close the session.

Alternatively, if there was a session
already, the program will be started in it
and the session will persist after closing
the program.

In both cases, an android activity will be
started. By default, it is bVnc viewer,
so you need to install it from play store
or github page.
